Undergraduate Researcher                Ladoke Akintola University of Technology _(Nov. 2022-May 2023)_
• Participated in a collaborative project focused on the in-silico and in-vivo evaluation of antiplasmodial 
efficacy of a novel antimalarial agent against murine malaria. 
• Utilized computational methods in R for differential gene expression analysis 
• Conducted molecular docking studies on murine malaria protein and a novel drug ligand 
• Collaborated in the haematological analysis on blood samples to evaluate drug effects 
• Performed statistical analysis in the context of the study's objectives 

### Work Experience
Medical Laboratory Scientist            Obafemi Awolowo University Teaching Hospital _(Jan. 2023–till date)_ 
• Conducting medical laboratory tests on patient samples to diagnose and monitor medical conditions.  
• Analysing blood, urine, tissue, and other bodily fluid specimens using specialized equipment and 
techniques. 
• Ensuring the accuracy and precision of test results by following established laboratory protocols and 
quality control procedures. 
• Recording and documenting test data, including patient information, test results, and any relevant 
observations. 
• Interpreting and analysing test results to provide healthcare professionals with accurate and timely 
information for patient care.

### Projects
#### Single cell RNA-Seq Analysis: Normal Hematopoietic Stem Cells and Leukemic Stem Cells in Chronic Myeloid Leukaemia 
https://github.com/Temitope-Alo/scRNA-Analysis---HSCs-vs-LSCs                
- Identified cell clusters from hematopoietic stem cells (HSC) and leukemic stem cells (LSC) found in patients with chronic myeloid leukaemia (chronic phase) and profiled differentially expressed genes in both HSC and LSC groups. 

#### Machine Learning on Prostate Cancer 
https://github.com/Temitope-Alo/Machine-learning-on-Prostate-Cancer              
_ Developed a predictive machine learning model using supervised and unsupervised ML techniques to distinguish between normal and cancerous tissues and to predict possible biomarkers associated with prostate cancer. 

#### GSE197178-RNA-seq-analysis 
https://github.com/Temitope-Alo/GSE197178-RNA-seq-analysis    
- RNA-seq analysis was performed on 4 CD13/CD33-positive and 4 CD13/CD33-negative B-ALL patients. 

#### RNA-seq Analysis Using PyDESeq        
https://github.com/Temitope-Alo/RNA-seq-Analysis-Using-PyDESeq 
- Utilised PyDESeq to analyse RNA-seq data from control (DMSO +) and △PfAP2-P (Rapamycin +) malaria parasites.
