## Projects
### Single cell RNA-Seq Analysis: Normal Hematopoietic Stem Cells and Leukemic Stem Cells in Chronic Myeloid Leukaemia
[GitHub](https://github.com/Temitope-Alo/scRNA-Analysis---HSCs-vs-LSCs) 

Identified cell clusters from hematopoietic stem cells (HSC) and leukemic stem cells (LSC) found in patients with chronic myeloid leukaemia (chronic phase) and profiled differentially expressed genes in both HSC and LSC groups.

### Machine Learning on Prostate Cancer 
[GitHub](https://github.com/Temitope-Alo/Machine-learning-on-Prostate-Cancer)

Developed a predictive machine learning model using supervised and unsupervised ML techniques to distinguish between normal and cancerous tissues and to predict possible biomarkers associated with prostate cancer.
